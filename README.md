## Disclaimer :warning:
This is not an official [Portainer]() software, it is just and Open Source tool to make an abstraction of the API.

## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This is a command line tool built in Python to use the [Portainer API]() to deploy Stacks and get Stacks Info throug Portainer API. The main use case for this application is to manage Stacks using the terminal in the CI/CD process, making it faster and easy.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Since it is a command line tool, you can inoke the application by running `portainer-deployer` after installation.

You will need to set some params such as the configuration of connection to [Portainer API]() before start using the application. This can be easly managed by running `portainer-deployer config <config arguments goes here>`. We'll go more in deep later in this doc.

### Examples

Get all the Stacks from portainer
```shell
$ portainer-deployer get --all 
```
Get Stacks by its id
```shell
$ portainer-deployer get --id <random-id>
```
Deploy Stack from file
```shell
$ portainer-deployer deploy --path <path to docker-compose file> --endpoint <endpoint to deploy> --update-keys <a.b.c=value e.f.g=value2>
```


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
